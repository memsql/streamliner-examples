MemSQL Spark Streamliner Examples
=================================
**MemSQL Streamliner is a deprecated feature, and will be deleted in MemSQL 6.0**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/memsql/streamliner-examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/memsql/streamliner-examples)

This is a repository featuring example code for the [MemSQL Spark Streamliner](http://docs.memsql.com/latest/spark/).

MemSQL Spark Streamliner lets you build custom Spark pipelines to:
   1. extract from real-time data sources such as Kafka,
   2. transform data structures such as CSV, JSON, or Thrift in table rows,
   3. load your data into MemSQL.

   - [Examples of Transformers](./src/main/scala/com/memsql/streamliner/examples/Transformers.scala)
   - ... and browse the code for more
